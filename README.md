# opensol
A research project for administrative software used by scouting groups.

## Project goals
The goal of OpenSOL is to provide a modern, efficient, and user-friendly administration system for Scouting Nederland. The system aims to streamline administrative tasks, improve communication, and enhance the overall experience for scouts, leaders, and administrators.

> Note: While the goal of this project is to provide functionality for Scouting Nederland, the authors of this repository acknowledge that this is not currently being asked of them. This repository is in no way affiliated with, endorsed by or connected to Scouting Nederland.

## Technology vision
- Build in the open: by open sourcing the codebase, we promote openness and security. This is also inviting for collaborators that have less time or only want to contribute once. A public roadmap is available and people are free to submit feature requests or bug reports.
- Cloud-native stack: By setting the platform up in a modular way, we promote a scalable and independent environment, ready for the future.
- Data-driven decision making: By measuring the platform in a detailed way and making decisions based on this data, we can take out the guesswork out of the functionality.

- .NET (latest STS release)
