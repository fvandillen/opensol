## Project goals
The goal of ScoutsOnline 4 is to provide a modern, efficient, and user-friendly administration system for Scouting Nederland. The system aims to streamline administrative tasks, improve communication, and enhance the overall experience for scouts, leaders, and administrators.

## Technology vision
- Build in the open: by open sourcing the codebase, we promote openness and security. This is also inviting for collaborators that have less time or only want to contribute once. A public roadmap is available and people are free to submit feature requests or bug reports.
- Cloud-native stack: By setting the platform up in a modular way, we promote a scalable and independent environment, ready for the future.
- Data-driven decision making: By measuring the platform in a detailed way and making decisions based on this data, we can take out the guesswork out of the functionality.
